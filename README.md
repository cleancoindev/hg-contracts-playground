# hg-contracts playground

This is an experimental [hg-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/hg-contracts) playground. It includes one `index.js` file that runs various stages of the contracts to interface with them. 

This only really makes sense for attendants of the PM 2.0 Coding Sessions.

Run with `node src/index` from root.

# Prerequisites

This package requires you to have the `hg-contracts` repository npm-linked. If you have `hg-contracts-playground` and `hg-contracts` in the same folder, you can run this from their parent folder:
```
cd hg-contracts
npm link
cd ../hg-contracts-playground
npm link ../hg-contracts`
```
